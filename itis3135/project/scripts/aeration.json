        "description": "Over time the dirt becomes compacted and makes it hard for your lawn to breathe and get the nutrients it needs. Aerating your lawn is good to do because it allows nutrients, water, and air to penetrate the soil. This allows fertilizing and ongoing watering to be much more effective. The process is simple and will not take our team long. We also offer additional lawn services after aeration for a discounted fee!"
